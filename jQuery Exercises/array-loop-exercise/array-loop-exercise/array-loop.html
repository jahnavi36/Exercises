      // Write a function that will:

        // Take the fruit array as an argument

        // Sort the fruit alphabetically (don't forget to make a copy of the array so you don't modify the original. Look up the array spread operator)

        // Map over each fruit and append a list item with the name of a fruit inside of it

        // Finally use jQuery to dump your html into the unordered list above


      // BONUS: When you click a fruit, it should be removed from the list
